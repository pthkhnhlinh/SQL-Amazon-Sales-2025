## Key Findings

### Product & Category Performance
- **Dominant Categories**: Electronics (63.14%) and Home Appliances (33.2%) dominate sales.
- **Top-Selling Products**: Laptops, Refrigerators, and Smartphones account for ~80% of completed sales.
- **Category Risk**: High cancellation rates found in Home Appliances (40%) and Clothing (32.5%).

### Sales Timing
- **Best Days for Sales**: Monday and Tuesday contribute over 35% of weekly sales.
- **Slowest Day**: Saturday, with only 8% of total sales — a potential opportunity for weekend promotions.

### Location Insights
- **Top Performing Cities**: Miami, Houston, and Los Angeles lead in sales volume.
- **High Cancellation Cities**: Los Angeles (53%), Miami (39%), and Dallas (38%) show elevated cancellation rates — indicating possible delivery, service, or customer experience issues.

### Payment Method Analysis
- **Most Popular**: PayPal (24% of orders), followed by Credit and Debit Cards.
- **Most Profitable**: PayPal generates nearly 40% of total sales revenue.
- **At-Risk Methods**: Gift Cards and Debit Cards have higher rates of pending or cancelled transactions.

### Order Status Trends
- Only 35.2% of orders were completed.
- Pending Orders represent 34% — may point to logistical or payment processing inefficiencies.
- Cancellation Rate is 30.8%, with Clothing and Home Appliances leading in failed transactions.

### Customer Behavior & Retention
- **Top Spender**: Olivia Wilson is top spender.
- **Most Loyal**: Emma Clark has the highest retention.
- **Retention Risks**: Jane Smith and David Lee are high spenders with low retention — candidates for re-engagement campaigns.

3. **Enhance PayPal Integration**: Given its high reliability and revenue impact.
4. **Stimulate Weekend Sales**: Launch targeted campaigns for Saturday and Sunday.
5. **Nurture Loyal Customers**: Reward high-retention customers with loyalty programs.
6. **Re-engage High-Spending, Low-Retention Customers**: Personalized promotions or feedback surveys.
